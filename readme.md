# Comparison between JavaScript and AssemblyScript performances

Tutorial from *Coding Tech* YouTube channel  
[WebAssembly Tutorial (WebAssembly vs JavaScript)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoxFeJbHK0)

The goal of this project was to :

- try WebAssembly made from AssemblyScript (a TypeScript-like language) with a step-by-step tutorial
- discover how the *Benchmark* Node module works, which is more comfortable than copying/pasting code on jsben.ch

## Functions used for this benchmark

- ***Add*** (2 numbers)
- ***Factorial*** (1 number)
- ***SquareArray***: square every number in an array (array passed as parameter)
- ***SquareArrayGen***: square every number in an array (array length passed as parameter)

## Results

[:bar_chart: The result of the benchmark can be found here](benchmark.md)
